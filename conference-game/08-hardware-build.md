## 1. Screen Specifications

### Acer B226WL Monitor (Already Owned)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model | Acer B226WL |
| Display area | 47.7 cm wide × 30.0 cm high |
| Bezel — left | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — right | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — top | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — bottom | 1.8 cm |
| **Total outer dimensions** | **50.5 cm wide × 33.2 cm high** |
| Panel depth (thickest) | ~5.5 cm (at hump on back) |
| Stand height range | 5 cm to 20 cm (from tabletop to bottom of screen) |
| Inputs | HDMI, VGA, DVI |
| Power | IEC C14 (standard PC power cable), EU plug |

**Photos of the actual monitor used for this build**:

![Acer B226WL front view](20260420_113506.jpg)
![Acer B226WL side view](20260420_113519.jpg)

Front and side views show the stand profile and how the cables (HDMI + power) route at the back. The stand base footprint and the panel depth inform the monitor shelf dimensions (30 cm deep × 55 cm wide).

**For the cabinet**: The monitor **keeps its stand** (non-removable). It sits on an internal shelf inside the cabinet, with the screen visible through a window cutout. The stand's built-in height adjustment (5-20cm) and tilt (~20°) are used to position the screen correctly.

### Screen Window Dimensions

The cabinet's front panel has a **window opening** sized to the visible display area only. The monitor bezels sit **behind** the plywood front panel (the panel overlaps the bezels, framing the screen cleanly).

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Window width | 48.7 cm (display 47.7 + 0.5 cm each side) |
| Window height | 31.0 cm (display 30.0 + 0.5 cm each side) |

## 2. Ergonomic Calculations

### Standing Player — 180cm Height

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Player height | 180 cm | Given (average) |
| Eye height | ~168 cm | ~93% of height |
| Table height | 90 cm | Given |
| Comfortable viewing angle | 15-20° below horizontal | Ergonomic standard |
| **Screen center above table** | **~65 cm** | Target |

---

## 3. Cabinet Design

### Material: Poplar Plywood 15mm

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Material | Poplar plywood |
| Thickness | 15mm (1.5cm) |
| Weight | ~6 kg/m² |
| Finish | Paint Naia Blue (#1A5F7A) + vinyl |

**Why poplar plywood over MDF?** ~50% lighter (6 kg/m² vs. 12 kg/m² for 18mm MDF) at equivalent structural strength. Easier to transport. Screws hold better than in MDF.

### Overall Dimensions

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cabinet width | 58 cm |
| Inner width (between side panels) | 55 cm (58 - 2×1.5) |
| Height at front | 95 cm |
| Height at back | 88 cm |
| Depth | 50 cm |
| Front panel tilt | 20° backward from vertical |
| Front panel surface length | 82 cm |
| Roof slope | ~8° (gentle, less dominant silhouette) |
| Mouse shelf total width | 108 cm (58 + 2×25 overhang) |
| Back | **Open** (no back panel) |

### Design Note: Roof Slope Reduced

The roof slope was reduced from the original 16.7° (15 cm drop over 50 cm) to **~8° (7 cm drop over 50 cm)**, following a design review:
- **Problem**: A steeply inclined roof made the cabinet silhouette feel top-heavy and could block viewing angles for taller spectators standing behind the player
- **Solution**: Flatten the slope while keeping the logo panel at the same front height (95 cm). Back height raised from 80 cm to 88 cm
- **Impact**: Small increase in back-of-cabinet height (~8 cm), slightly longer roof panel (~51 cm vs. 52.2 cm), otherwise unchanged

### Key Geometry

The front panel is tilted 20° backward — bottom at the front edge, top receding 28cm into the cabinet. A horizontal **soffit panel** (G) bridges the gap between the front panel top and the logo panel, blocking lightbox light from shining downward and supporting the lightbox assembly. Above the soffit, a vertical logo panel faces the player directly. The roof slopes gently from 95cm (front) to 88cm (back).

```
Side profile points (depth, height in cm):
A (0, 0)      — front bottom
B (28.0, 77.1) — top of front panel (tilted)
C (0, 77.1)    — logo panel bottom / front edge at that height
D (0, 95)      — logo panel top / roof front
E (50, 88)     — roof back / back top  (gentle ~8° slope)
F (50, 0)      — back bottom
```

### Assembled Views

See [`cabinet-panels.html`](cabinet-panels.html) for interactive SVG views:
- **Front view**: Shows the cabinet as the player sees it — logo lightbox panel at top, front panel with screen window, mouse shelf with overhangs
- **45° perspective view**: Shows the tilted front panel receding backward, side panel profile, angled roof, and the screen visible through the window cutout

- Area: ~0.36 m² each
- Weight: ~2.2 kg each

### Panel D: Front Panel (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm (inner width) |
| Height | 82 cm (surface length along 20° tilt) |
| Screen window cutout | 48.7 × 31.0 cm |
| Material | Poplar plywood 15mm |
| Weight | ~2.3 kg |

Tilted 20° backward. The bottom edge sits at the front, the top edge recedes 28cm into the cabinet.

### Panel E: Roof Panel (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Length | 50.5 cm (slope: √(50² + 7²)) |
| Angle | ~8° from horizontal |
| Weight | ~1.7 kg |

Angled panel spanning from front top (95cm) to back top (80cm).

### Panel F: Logo Panel — Illuminated Lightbox (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Height | 17.9 cm |
| Construction | Lightbox (see below) |
| Weight | ~0.6 kg |

Vertical panel at the front of the cabinet, above the tilted front panel. This is the main branding surface — the first thing visitors see. **Built as an illuminated lightbox** with backlit Naia logo.

#### Lightbox Construction (2 layers + soffit)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Front: 3mm opal acrylic             │  ← diffuses LED light evenly
│  ──────────────────────────────────  │
│  Back: 3mm white foamboard + LED     │  ← LED strip in zigzag pattern
│  ──────────────────────────────────  │
│  Bottom: Soffit panel (plywood 15mm) │  ← blocks light downward, supports lightbox
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The logo panel lightbox rests on the **soffit panel** (Panel G) which closes the gap between the logo panel and the top of the tilted front panel. The soffit:
- **Supports the lightbox**: acrylic + foamboard sandwich sits on top of the soffit
- **Blocks downward light**: prevents LED light from shining into the player's face
- **Adds structural rigidity**: connects logo panel area to front panel top

No aluminum U-channel needed — the foamboard strip spacers (2cm wide, cut from the same foamboard sheet) create the gap between acrylic and LED backing. These are glued around the perimeter edges.

#### Vinyl Decal Design

![Logo panel design](naia-arcade-panel-2165x705-300dpi%20(2).png)

Retro arcade-style design with the Naia logo centered on a dark background with radial glow. Key elements:
- **Center**: Naia logo (blue-cyan-purple gradient) with bright radial glow behind it
- **Background**: Dark with subtle grid lines and colored particle dots (arcade aesthetic)
- **Border**: Neon magenta/pink frame with cyan outer edge
- **Backlight effect**: The bright glow zone around the logo lets LED light through the opal acrylic, creating a halo effect. Dark areas block the light, providing contrast

The vinyl decal is applied on the *inside* of the opal acrylic (protected from scratches, backlit evenly by LED).

**Assembly**: Mount LED strip on foamboard in zigzag pattern. Glue 2cm foamboard spacer strips around the perimeter. Sandwich acrylic (front) onto spacers. Place the assembly on the soffit panel. Connect to 24V supply.

**Total lightbox cost: ~€20-35** (no aluminum U-channel needed)

### Panel G: Soffit Panel (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Depth | 28.0 cm |
| Weight | ~0.9 kg |

Horizontal panel at Y=77.1cm (top of front panel / bottom of logo panel). Closes the gap between the vertical logo panel (front) and the top of the tilted front panel (rear). Functions:
- Supports the lightbox assembly (acrylic + foamboard rest on top)
- Blocks LED light from shining downward into the cabinet / player's face
- Adds structural connection between logo panel and front panel

### Panel H: Monitor Shelf (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Depth | 30 cm |
| Height (mounted at) | 38 cm |
| Weight | ~1.0 kg |
