# 08 - Hardware Build: Tabletop Arcade Cabinet

## Overview

A custom tabletop arcade cabinet houses the game screen and provides a comfortable, eye-catching setup for conference play. It sits on a standard table (90cm height) and is designed for a standing player of average height (180cm).

The cabinet is built from **poplar plywood 15mm** panels, with a slot for the Acer monitor, a flat mouse shelf, and a Naia-branded illuminated logo panel (lightbox).

## 1. Screen Specifications

### Acer Monitor

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display area | 47.7 cm wide × 30.0 cm high |
| Bezel — left | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — right | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — top | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — bottom | 1.8 cm |
| **Total outer dimensions** | **50.5 cm wide × 33.2 cm high** |
| Panel depth (thickest) | ~5.5 cm (at hump on back) |
| Stand height range | 5 cm to 20 cm (from tabletop to bottom of screen) |
| Inputs | HDMI, VGA, DVI |
| Power | IEC C14 (standard PC power cable), EU plug |

**For the cabinet**: The monitor **keeps its stand** (non-removable). It sits on an internal shelf inside the cabinet, with the screen visible through a window cutout. The stand's built-in height adjustment (5-20cm) and tilt (~20°) are used to position the screen correctly.

### Screen Window Dimensions

The cabinet's front panel has a **window opening** sized to the visible display area only. The monitor bezels sit **behind** the plywood front panel (the panel overlaps the bezels, framing the screen cleanly).

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Window width | 48.7 cm (display 47.7 + 0.5 cm each side) |
| Window height | 31.0 cm (display 30.0 + 0.5 cm each side) |

## 2. Ergonomic Calculations

### Standing Player — 180cm Height

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Player height | 180 cm | Given (average) |
| Eye height | ~168 cm | ~93% of height |
| Table height | 90 cm | Given |
| Comfortable viewing angle | 15-20° below horizontal | Ergonomic standard |
| **Screen center above table** | **~65 cm** | Target |

---

## 3. Cabinet Design

### Material: Poplar Plywood 15mm

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Material | Poplar plywood |
| Thickness | 15mm (1.5cm) |
| Weight | ~6 kg/m² |
| Finish | Paint Naia Blue (#1A5F7A) + vinyl |

**Why poplar plywood over MDF?** ~50% lighter (6 kg/m² vs. 12 kg/m² for 18mm MDF) at equivalent structural strength. Easier to transport. Screws hold better than in MDF.

### Overall Dimensions

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cabinet width | 58 cm |
| Inner width (between side panels) | 55 cm (58 - 2×1.5) |
| Height at front | 95 cm |
| Height at back | 80 cm |
| Depth | 50 cm |
| Front panel tilt | 20° backward from vertical |
| Front panel surface length | 82 cm |
| Mouse shelf total width | 108 cm (58 + 2×25 overhang) |
| Back | **Open** (no back panel) |

### Key Geometry

The front panel is tilted 20° backward — bottom at the front edge, top receding 28cm into the cabinet. Above it, a vertical logo panel faces the player directly. The roof slopes from 95cm (front) to 80cm (back).

```
Side profile points (depth, height in cm):
A (0, 0)      — front bottom
B (28.0, 77.1) — top of front panel (tilted)
C (0, 77.1)    — logo panel bottom / front edge at that height
D (0, 95)      — logo panel top / roof front
E (50, 80)     — roof back / back top
F (50, 0)      — back bottom
```

### Assembled Views

See `cabinet-panels.html` for interactive SVG views:
- **Front view**: Shows the cabinet as the player sees it — logo lightbox panel at top, front panel with screen window, mouse shelf with overhangs
- **45° perspective view**: Shows the tilted front panel receding backward, side panel profile, angled roof, and the screen visible through the window cutout
