## 1. Screen Specifications

### Acer B226WL Monitor (Already Owned)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model | Acer B226WL |
| Display area | 47.7 cm wide × 30.0 cm high |
| Bezel — left | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — right | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — top | 1.4 cm |
| Bezel — bottom | 1.8 cm |
| **Total outer dimensions** | **50.5 cm wide × 33.2 cm high** |
| Panel depth (thickest) | ~5.5 cm (at hump on back) |
| Stand height range | 5 cm to 20 cm (from tabletop to bottom of screen) |
| Inputs | HDMI, VGA, DVI |

**Photos of the actual monitor used for this build**:

![Acer B226WL front view](20260420_113506.jpg)
![Acer B226WL side view](20260420_113519.jpg)

Front and side views show the stand profile and how the cables (HDMI + power) route at the back. The stand base footprint and the panel depth inform the monitor shelf dimensions (30 cm deep × 55 cm wide).

**For the cabinet**: The monitor **keeps its stand** (non-removable). It sits on an internal shelf inside the cabinet, with the screen visible through a window cutout. The stand's built-in height adjustment (5-20cm) and tilt (~20°) are used to position the screen correctly.

### Screen Window Dimensions

The cabinet's front panel has a **window opening** sized to the visible display area only. The monitor bezels sit **behind** the plywood front panel (the panel overlaps the bezels, framing the screen cleanly).

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Window width | 48.7 cm (display 47.7 + 0.5 cm each side) |
| Window height | 31.0 cm (display 30.0 + 0.5 cm each side) |

## 2. Ergonomic Calculations

### Standing Player — 180cm Height

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Player height | 180 cm | Given (average) |
| Eye height | ~168 cm | ~93% of height |
| Table height | 90 cm | Given |
| Comfortable viewing angle | 15-20° below horizontal | Ergonomic standard |
| **Screen center above table** | **~65 cm** | Target |

---

## 3. Cabinet Design

### Material: Poplar Plywood 15mm

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Material | Poplar plywood |
| Thickness | 15mm (1.5cm) |
| Weight | ~6 kg/m² |
| Finish | Paint Naia Blue (#1A5F7A) + vinyl |

**Why poplar plywood over MDF?** ~50% lighter (6 kg/m² vs. 12 kg/m² for 18mm MDF) at equivalent structural strength. Easier to transport. Screws hold better than in MDF.

### Overall Dimensions

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cabinet width | 58 cm |
| Inner width (between side panels) | 55 cm (58 - 2×1.5) |
| Height at front (top of logo panel) | 95 cm |
| Height at back | 88 cm |
| Depth | 50 cm |
| Front panel tilt | 20° backward from vertical |
| Front panel surface length | 82 cm |
| **Logo panel recess from front face** | **10 cm** (Z = 10 cm) |
| Soffit panel depth | 18 cm |
| Roof slope | ~10° (run = 40 cm, rise = 7 cm) |
| Mouse shelf total width | 108 cm (58 + 2×25 overhang) |
| Back | **Open** (no back panel) |

### Key Geometry

The front panel is tilted 20° backward — bottom at the front edge, top receding 28 cm into the cabinet. The **logo panel is recessed 10 cm** from the cabinet front face (at Z = 10 cm instead of Z = 0 cm). A horizontal **soffit panel** (G, 18 cm deep) bridges the gap between the front panel top (Z = 28) and the logo panel bottom (Z = 10), blocking lightbox light from shining downward and supporting the lightbox assembly. The roof slopes gently from the logo top (Z = 10, Y = 95 cm) to the back edge (Z = 50, Y = 88 cm).

```
Side profile points (depth, height in cm):
A (0, 0)      — front bottom
B (28.0, 77.1) — top of front panel (tilted)
C (10, 77.1)   — logo panel bottom / soffit front edge  (shifted 10cm back)
D (10, 95)     — logo panel top / roof front            (shifted 10cm back)
E (50, 88)     — roof back / back top
F (50, 0)      — back bottom
```

| Logo top → Roof back | D→E | 40.6 cm (~10° roof slope, `√(40² + 7²)`) |
| Back edge | E→F | 88 cm (vertical) |
| Bottom | F→A | 50 cm (horizontal) |

Features:
- Slot markers at 8, 12, and 16cm height for adjustable mouse shelf position
- Monitor shelf support at Y=38cm
- Area: ~0.36 m² each
- Weight: ~2.2 kg each

### Panel D: Front Panel (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm (inner width) |
| Height | 82 cm (surface length along 20° tilt) |
| Screen window cutout | 48.7 × 31.0 cm |
| Material | Poplar plywood 15mm |
| Weight | ~2.3 kg |

Tilted 20° backward. The bottom edge sits at the front, the top edge recedes 28cm into the cabinet.

### Panel E: Roof Panel (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Length | 40.6 cm (slope: √(40² + 7²) — run = 40 after the 10 cm recess) |
| Angle | ~10° from horizontal |
| Weight | ~1.3 kg |

Angled panel spanning from front top (95cm) to back top (80cm).

### Panel F: Logo Panel — Illuminated Lightbox (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Height | 17.9 cm |
| Construction | Lightbox (see below) |
| Weight | ~0.6 kg |

Vertical panel at the front of the cabinet, above the tilted front panel. This is the main branding surface — the first thing visitors see. **Built as an illuminated lightbox** with backlit Naia logo.

#### Lightbox Construction (2 layers + soffit)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Front: 3mm opal acrylic             │  ← diffuses LED light evenly
│  ──────────────────────────────────  │
│  Back: 3mm white foamboard + LED     │  ← LED strip in zigzag pattern
│  ──────────────────────────────────  │
│  Bottom: Soffit panel (plywood 15mm) │  ← blocks light downward, supports lightbox
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The logo panel lightbox rests on the **soffit panel** (Panel G) which closes the gap between the logo panel and the top of the tilted front panel. The soffit:
- **Supports the lightbox**: acrylic + foamboard sandwich sits on top of the soffit
- **Blocks downward light**: prevents LED light from shining into the player's face
- **Adds structural rigidity**: connects logo panel area to front panel top

No aluminum U-channel needed — the foamboard strip spacers (2cm wide, cut from the same foamboard sheet) create the gap between acrylic and LED backing. These are glued around the perimeter edges.

#### Vinyl Decal Design

![Logo panel design](naia-arcade-panel-2165x705-300dpi%20(2).png)

Retro arcade-style design with the Naia logo centered on a dark background with radial glow. Key elements:
- **Center**: Naia logo (blue-cyan-purple gradient) with bright radial glow behind it
- **Background**: Dark with subtle grid lines and colored particle dots (arcade aesthetic)
- **Border**: Neon magenta/pink frame with cyan outer edge
- **Backlight effect**: The bright glow zone around the logo lets LED light through the opal acrylic, creating a halo effect. Dark areas block the light, providing contrast

The vinyl decal is applied on the *inside* of the opal acrylic (protected from scratches, backlit evenly by LED).

**Assembly**: Mount LED strip on foamboard in zigzag pattern. Glue 2cm foamboard spacer strips around the perimeter. Sandwich acrylic (front) onto spacers. Place the assembly on the soffit panel. Connect to 24V supply.

**Total lightbox cost: ~€20-35** (no aluminum U-channel needed)

### Panel G: Soffit Panel (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Depth | 18.0 cm |
| Weight | ~0.6 kg |

Horizontal panel at Y = 77.1 cm, spanning from the front panel top (Z = 28) forward to the (recessed) logo panel bottom (Z = 10). The 10 cm between Z = 0 (cabinet front face) and Z = 10 (soffit front edge) is open air — this is the recess that improves screen sight-line. Functions:
- Supports the lightbox assembly (acrylic + foamboard rest on top)
- Blocks LED light from shining downward into the cabinet / player's face
- Adds structural connection between logo panel and front panel top

### Panel H: Monitor Shelf (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Width | 55 cm |
| Depth | 30 cm |
| Height (mounted at) | 38 cm |
| Weight | ~1.0 kg |

Structural shelf — supports the monitor on its stand (~5 kg). Must be sturdy.

### Panel M: Mouse Shelf (×1)

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total width | 108 cm (25 + 58 + 25) |
| Depth | 25 cm |
| Weight | ~1.6 kg |

Single wide panel that slides through slots in both side panels. The center section passes through the cabinet, the 25cm overhangs on each side provide mouse areas. Three slot height options: 8, 12, or 16cm above table. Mouse pads placed on each overhang.

### Cut List Summary

| ID | Panel | Qty | Dimensions | Weight | Material |
|----|-------|-----|-----------|--------|----------|
| A | Side panel | 2 | Complex 6-point shape (with 10 cm top-front inset) | 2×2.1 = 4.2 kg | Poplar ply 15mm |
| D | Front panel | 1 | 55 × 82 cm (window cutout) | 2.3 kg | Poplar ply 15mm |
| E | Roof panel | 1 | 55 × 40.6 cm | 1.3 kg | Poplar ply 15mm |
| F | Logo panel (lightbox) | 1 | 55 × 17.9 cm | 0.6 kg | Acrylic + foamboard + LED |
| G | Soffit panel | 1 | 55 × 18.0 cm | 0.6 kg | Poplar ply 15mm |
| H | Monitor shelf | 1 | 55 × 30 cm | 1.0 kg | Poplar ply 15mm |
| M | Mouse shelf | 1 | 108 × 25 cm | 1.6 kg | Poplar ply 15mm |
| | **Total cabinet** | **8 panels** | | **~11 kg** | |

No base panel — the structure is stable enough with the roof panel, soffit, monitor shelf, front panel, logo panel, and mouse shelf providing 6 connection points between the side panels.
