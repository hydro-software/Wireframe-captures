# 07 - Conference Setup

## Hardware

### Game Station (Single PC Setup)

| Item | Spec | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Screen (game) | 27" monitor, 1920x1080, IPS | Large enough for spectators. IPS for viewing angles |
| Screen (scoreboard) | 40-55" TV | Connected as extended display to same PC |
| Mouse | Wired USB | Wireless = battery risk. For drawing + clicking |
| Computer | Laptop or mini-PC, 8GB+ RAM | Game runs locally — needs Node.js installed |
| HDMI cable | **5 meters** | Long enough to reach the TV from the arcade cabinet |
| HDMI adapter | USB-C → HDMI (if needed) | Depends on mini-PC/laptop ports |
| Power | 4 outlets | PC + monitor + TV + LED transformer, use surge-protected strip |

**No separate computer for scoreboard.** Both the game and scoreboard run on the same machine — game on the primary screen, scoreboard in a second browser window on the TV.

**No keyboard needed.** All text input (email, name) uses an on-screen virtual keyboard operated by mouse. This keeps the arcade cabinet clean and prevents theft/damage.

### Internet (Optional)

| Situation | What works |
|-----------|-----------|
| Good WiFi | Google Sheets sync + results email work |
| Spotty WiFi | Game works perfectly, sync catches up when connection returns |
| No internet | Game works 100%. Export CSV from admin panel at end of day |

Internet is **nice-to-have** for a single console, but **required for 2 consoles** (to sync the shared leaderboard via Google Sheets). Each console works 100% offline for gameplay — only the combined Classement needs WiFi. If WiFi drops, each console falls back to its own local leaderboard.

### Multi-Console Setup (2 Arcade Cabinets)

When running 2 consoles at the same booth:
1. Both PCs connect to conference WiFi
2. Both run the same Nuxt app with different `CONSOLE_ID` (`C1` and `C2`) in `.env`
3. Both write scores to the same Google Sheet (with write verification)
4. The Classement on each TV shows the **combined** leaderboard from both consoles
5. If WiFi drops: gameplay continues, each console shows its local leaderboard with "⚠ Mode local"
6. When WiFi returns: unsynced scores sync automatically, combined leaderboard rebuilds

## Software Setup

### Pre-Install on Game PC

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js (v20+)
# 2. Copy the game folder to the PC
# 3. Build (one-time)
cd naia-conference-game
npm install
npm run build

# 4. Test
node .output/server/index.mjs
# → open http://localhost:3000
```

### Game Day Startup

**Windows** — double-click `start.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting Naia Conference Game...
cd /d "%~dp0"
start "" "http://localhost:3000"
timeout /t 2 >nul
start "" "http://localhost:3000/classement"
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

**Manual startup**:
```bash
# Terminal
cd naia-conference-game
node .output/server/index.mjs

# Then open:
# Primary screen: http://localhost:3000
# TV (drag to second screen): http://localhost:3000/classement → F11 for fullscreen
```

### Kiosk Mode (Optional)

```bash
# Chrome kiosk — game (primary screen)
chrome --kiosk --disable-session-crashed-bubble \
  --disable-infobars --noerrdialogs \
  --app="http://localhost:3000"

# Chrome kiosk — scoreboard (TV)
chrome --kiosk \
  --app="http://localhost:3000/classement?conference=hydro-2025"
```

## Staffing

### Game Host (1 person, always at booth)
- Invites visitors: "Can you spot why this plant lost EUR 11,000?"
- Explains drawing mechanic quickly: "Tracez où la production aurait dû être"
- Manages queue (switch to Quick Play if >3 waiting)
- Resets game if needed (F5 to refresh)

### Sales Person (1 person, during busy times)
- Engages players after results: "You found EUR 8,000 — imagine Naia doing this for YOUR plant"
- Books demos, captures leads
- Handles deeper product questions

- Queue length (observed)
- Most common false loss areas (players misidentifying normal production as losses)

### Post-Conference
- Email open rate (if emails sent)
- CTA click-through rate
- Demo bookings from game leads
- Trial signups attributed to game
- Social media mentions
